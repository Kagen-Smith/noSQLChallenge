# noSQLChallenge

## Description

This project is an API for a social networking web application, developed with Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It enables users to share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and manage their friend lists. Designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data, itâ€™s well-suited for scalable social media platforms. The project was driven by a desire to gain practical experience with NoSQL databases and explore how they handle flexible data structures in social networks. It tackles the challenge of efficiently scaling and organizing vast user data. Throughout the project, I learned how to model unstructured data with MongoDB, create schemas with Mongoose, build RESTful API routes, and use virtuals to dynamically calculate data such as friend and reaction counts, all while effectively managing timestamps.
